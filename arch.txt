inputs: interface, xml config with tcp and udp ports, xml config with
   mac address vendor mappings

Coming up with lists to scan.
get interface's ip and netmask
get network name
start at network name + 1
add 1 until ip & netmask != network

for each ip add it with udp ports from config and tcp ports from config 
-> udp port list
-> tcp port list

send dummy udp request (raw socket?) (close socket)

tcp 
  - open socket 
  - map socket fd to ip and port
  - set to non-blocking
  - connect
  - process connect return value (hopefully EAGAIN)

lookup up mac addresses in arp table

select on pcap and connect sockets
(maybe select on connect sockets, check pcap)
if pcap fd, pcap_next if icmp, destination port unreachable, decode
  ip header is icmp body and look up ip and port(s) and flag as close
  if udp response to sending port, look up ip and port and flag as open
